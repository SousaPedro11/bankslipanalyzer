### What problem was solved?
Please explain the changes that were made to solve the problem. It is not necessary to go into great detail, a high-level description will suffice to give an understanding of the code.

If necessary, you can reference the Jira ticket to improve understanding, but remember that the idea here is to give a general specification of how other people can review the PR and not force the reviewer to delve into the ticket to understand everything in detail.

### How to test?
Please describe if any additional tests need to be performed to ensure the solution is working properly. In some cases, the impact of the change may affect other services or scripts may need to be run to test the solution. Use this space to notify the reviewer of any such requirements.

### Other information
Is there anything else you would like to disclose? Use this space to notify of any structural changes, extra optimizations or any other problems that were solved in conjunction, code compatibility issues, etc.
